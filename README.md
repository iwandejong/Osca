# Osca
Welcome to the Osca community! Here is a bit of fanformation ;)

Osca started in 2021 as an initiative with self-taught coder and matriculant, Iwan de Jong in the frustration of searching for every line of code on the 'net.

Osca is currently striving to ease the process of coding by giving clear information on every language (currently only Front-end languages and frameworks). The idea is not to kill documentation-websites from their respective owners, instead, Osca compiles useful information on the web and translates it into a minimal and focused website for users to access easily.
